Features
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.
Visualization: Create informative and visually appealing plots and charts to communicate findings and trends effectively.
Modeling: Build machine learning models for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks to predict outcomes and make data-driven decisions.
Utilities: Access a variety of utility functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Installation
To use Data Head, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/adedotun-adams-0322a1154
git clone https://github.com/adamsadedotun/Customer-Churn.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd data-head
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code

Usage
Data Analysis:

python
Copy code
# Import the necessary modules
import data_head as dh

# Load the dataset
data = dh.load_dataset('your_dataset.csv')

# Perform exploratory data analysis
summary_stats = dh.summarize_data(data)
print(summary_stats)
Visualization:

python
Copy code
# Import the necessary modules
import data_head.visualization as dhv

# Create a histogram of a numerical variable
dhv.plot_histogram(data['numerical_column'])
Modeling:

python
Copy code
# Import the necessary modules
import data_head.modeling as dhm

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = dhm.train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Train a machine learning model
model = dhm.train_model(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = dhm.evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')# Customer-Churn
